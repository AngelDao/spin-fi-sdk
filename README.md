# Spin Fi Rust SDK

This repo creates a simple wrapper to interact with [Spin Fi](https://spin.fi) NEAR spot markets using the [NEAR Rust Client](https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs)

## Design

The SDK is broken down into 2 types of of interactions the views and sends. Where view namespaces will only pull data from the contract and send namespaces will send a tx to a contract.

## Getting started

see `main.rs` for examples of config and all method examples
